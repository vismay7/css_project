                  Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He
                  knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an
                  expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The
                  problem was that there was nobody interested in the
                  information besides him and he knew it. Years of information
                  painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even
                  an ounce of interest in the topic.

                  She nervously peered over the edge. She understood in her mind
                  that the view was supposed to be beautiful, but all she felt
                  was fear. There had always been something about heights that
                  disturbed her, and now she could feel the full force of this
                  unease. She reluctantly crept a little closer with the
                  encouragement of her friends as the fear continued to build.
                  She couldn't help but feel that something horrible was about
                  to happen.

                  Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different
                  shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as
                  needed. But don't make them too big or they might just pop,
                  and then bye-bye balloon. It'll be gone and lost for the rest
                  of mankind. They can serve a variety of purposes, from
                  decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your
                  head to think a little bit about what to do with them.

                  Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound
                  themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as
                  their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of
                  the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or
                  bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this
                  was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the
                  vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once
                  pristine ant highway.

                  He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes
                  throughout the entire process. It had been perfection and he
                  knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at

                  MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There was something that
                  made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit easier
                  when she wore it. She really didn't care what those staring
                  through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her

                  He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could
                  fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so
                  that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise
                  angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken
                  years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting
                  any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the
                  beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who
                  watched in amazement.

                  It was a concerning development that he couldn't get out of
                  his mind. He'd had many friends throughout his early years and
                  had fond memories of playing with them, but he couldn't
                  understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as he
                  grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very
                  last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last.

                  The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for
                  years. It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they
                  enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. The scars
                  gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it
                  had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.

                  His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to
                  say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He
                  explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation
                  as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that
                  grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him
                  where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't help
                  that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to
                  him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.

                  She had come to the conclusion that you could tell a lot about
                  a person by their ears. The way they stuck out and the size of
                  the earlobes could give you wonderful insights into the
                  person. Of course, she couldn't scientifically prove any of
                  this, but that didn't matter to her. Before anything else, she
                  would size up the ears of the person she was talking to.
