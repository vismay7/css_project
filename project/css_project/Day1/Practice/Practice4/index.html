                intelligence.[11][12][13] Its parent company Alphabet is

                Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by Larry Page and
                Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University
                in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly
                listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power
                through super-voting stock. The company went public via an
                initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was
                reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google
                is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for
                Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was
                appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry
                Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019,
                Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.
